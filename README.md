# Game-Project

First I started out by picking a specific theme for my project (based on my real life). This is the inspiration behind the game (show picture of Chase eatting cookies.)

I created my folder and files inside my folder linking them so they could all work together, and then I got to researching - on top of what we learned in class I watched countless YouTube video's on what would be the most efficent way to create a game. 

drum roll please ~~~ CANVAS ~~~~

What is HTML Canvas? (definition from W3Schools)
The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.
The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.
Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.
