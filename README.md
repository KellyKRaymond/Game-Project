# Game-Project

First I started out by picking a specific theme for my project (based on my real life). This is the inspiration behind the game (show picture of Chase eatting cookies.)

I created my folder and files inside my folder linking them so they could all work together, and then I got to researching - on top of what we learned in class I watched countless YouTube video's on what would be the most efficent way to create a game. 

drum roll please ~~~ CANVAS ~~~~

What is HTML Canvas? (definition from W3Schools)
The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.
The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.
Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.


ctx.beginPath();
ctx.fillStyle = 'yellow'
ctx.fillRect(400,450,50,50);  // first two numbers represent where on the canvas the item will be when set to 10,10 they were in the upper left hand corner
I had to move the to 400/450 pixles away from the 0 index (top left corner)
ctx.stroke();
