# Game-Project

First I started out by picking a specific theme for my project (based on my real life). This is the inspiration behind the game 
(show picture of Chase eatting cookies.)

I created my folder and files inside my folder linking them so they could all work together, and then I got to researching - on top of what we learned in class I watched countless YouTube video's on what would be the most efficent way to create a game for my idea is Canvas

things I learned prior to this project but found their way in include, setting up variables, for looping over information so it reads each part one by one. Scopes and where I am calling functions. 

explain side scroller vs platformer view of the screen - basically my character and all the objects aren't actually moving. the entire screen is being cleared pixle by pixle every mil-a second, creating the illusion that the characters are moving certain directions - up and down - side to side. 


What is HTML Canvas? (definition from W3Schools)
The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.
The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.
Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.

Resources utilized: Class notes, classmates, office hours, Eric and Chelsea, and Abe - as well as YouTube I really enjoyed the 'code train' and ' & 'chris course' accounts on YouTube

Easiest part for me was coming up with (too many) ideas and getting ahead of myself with graphics and planning - not realizing how many functions go into each detail. I find the creative / graphic parts come easily to me. This was also the hardest part at the same time, because I had so many idea's what to do with the game that I struggled to figure out how I wanted the objects to impact the health, the mom to run on a loop etc. 

The hardest part for me is getting the code to work and getting it to do what I think it should. There was many times where I would be on the correct path, but have something small like brackets or paranethesis off which would then give me a bunch of errors. 

- Things that became easier, checking my console on my web browser to see what the error codes were, pushing my updates to gitHub so they were saved 
- remembering to push my work into gitHub after big changes 
- using more keypad short cuts, control f / find, control d/ to highlight the same items, etc. 
- searching for mistakes such as incorrect punctuation, capitals vs. lowercase letters 
- asking for help before I get myself too confused - even if its the middle of the night and I keep crashing my web browser #thanksAbe
- Time management is still a struggle for me, I was able to cut back on work but I let myself get hung up in details. 
So I spent a lot of time at
