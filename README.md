# Game-Project

First I started out by picking a specific theme for my project (based on my real life). This is the inspiration behind the game (show picture of Chase eatting cookies.)

I created my folder and files inside my folder linking them so they could all work together, and then I got to researching - on top of what we learned in class I watched countless YouTube video's on what would be the most efficent way to create a game for my idea is Canvas

What is HTML Canvas? (definition from W3Schools)
The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.
The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.
Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.

Resources utilized: Class notes, classmates, office hours, Eric and Chelsea - as well as YouTube I really enjoyed the 'code train' and ' & 'chris course' accounts on YouTube

Biggest challenge for me was every time I added something and didn't have it complete or wasn't 100% correct - EVERYTHING would disappear off my canvas and I would be left with the 
blue frame around my box - I couldn't even visualize or pint point what I was messing with. ~~~ i had an extra } at the end of my code which was why it was doing this.
easiest part for me was coming up with (too many) ideas and getting ahead of myself with graphics and planning - not realizing how many functions go into each detail. 

- Things that became easier, checking my console on my web browser to see what the error codes were, pushing my updates to gitHub so they were saved
